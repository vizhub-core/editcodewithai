I'll help implement the `add` function to pass the test. Only the functions.mjs file needs to be updated:

**functions.mjs**
```js
// Implement the add function
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

The implementation is straightforward:
1. Takes two parameters a and b
2. Returns their sum using the + operator
3. Exports the function so it can be imported in index.mjs

This will pass the test case checking if add(3,4) equals 7.

The index.mjs file can remain unchanged since the test is already correctly set up.

Let me know if you would like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail!
