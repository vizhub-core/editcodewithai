I'll help implement the multiply function in functions.mjs to pass the unit test. Here are the changes needed:

**functions.mjs**
```js
export function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```

The index.mjs file doesn't need any changes since the test is already correctly written, but for completeness:

**index.mjs**
```js
import { multiply } from "./functions.mjs";

const result = multiply(6, 7);
if (result !== 42) {
  console.error("Test failed: expected 42, got", result);
  process.exit(1);
}
console.log("Multiply test passed");
process.exit(0);
```

This implementation:
1. Exports a multiply function that takes two parameters a and b
2. Uses JavaScript's * operator to multiply the numbers
3. Returns the result
4. Will pass the test case of multiply(6, 7) === 42

The test will now pass and output "Multiply test passed" when run.
