I'll help implement the `square` function in functions.mjs. Only functions.mjs needs to be updated:

**functions.mjs**
```js
export function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}
```

The implementation simply multiplies x by itself and returns the result. No other files need to be modified since index.mjs already contains the correct test code.

This implementation:
1. Takes a number x as input 
2. Multiplies x by itself using the * operator
3. Returns the result
4. Is properly exported for use in index.mjs

The test in index.mjs will pass since square(5) correctly returns 25.
