I'll implement the `square` function as requested.

**functions.mjs**

```js
// TODO: Implement the square function
export function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}
```

The implementation is very simple - I've completed the `square` function to multiply the input value by itself, which is the mathematical definition of squaring a number.

The `index.mjs` file doesn't need any changes as it already correctly imports and tests the `square` function.
