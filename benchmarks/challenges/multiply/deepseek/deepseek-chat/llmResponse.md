**functions.mjs**

```js
// Implement the multiply function
export function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```

The `index.mjs` file is already correct and doesn't need to be modified. The only change needed is to implement the `multiply` function in `functions.mjs` to correctly multiply the two input numbers.
