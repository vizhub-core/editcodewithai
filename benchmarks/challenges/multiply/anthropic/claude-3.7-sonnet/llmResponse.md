I'll implement the `multiply` function to correctly pass the unit test. Here's the updated file:

**functions.mjs**

```js
// Implement the multiply function
export function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```

I've implemented the multiply function to simply return the product of the two input parameters. This will correctly calculate 6 * 7 = 42 and pass the test in index.mjs.

Note that the index.mjs file doesn't need any changes as it's already correctly set up to test the multiply function.
