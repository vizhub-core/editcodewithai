**functions.mjs**

```js
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

The implementation of the `add` function is straightforward - it simply returns the sum of its two arguments. This implementation will pass the test in `index.mjs` since `3 + 4` equals `7`. No changes are needed to `index.mjs` since it already contains a valid test case.
