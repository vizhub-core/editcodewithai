I'll solve this by implementing the `add` function in `functions.mjs`.

**functions.mjs**

```js
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

The solution is straightforward:
- The function takes two parameters `a` and `b`
- It returns their sum using the `+` operator
- This will pass the test in `index.mjs` which checks if `add(3, 4)` returns `7`

The implementation is simple and direct, matching the requirements of the test case. No other files need to be modified.
