**functions.mjs**

```js
// Implement the reverseString function
export function reverseString(str) {
  return str.split('').reverse().join('');
}
```

The `index.mjs` file is correct and doesn't need any changes. The implementation in `functions.mjs` now correctly reverses the string by splitting it into an array of characters, reversing the array, and then joining it back into a string.
