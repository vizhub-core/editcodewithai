I'll help implement the reverseString function. Only the functions.mjs file needs to be updated.

**functions.mjs**
```js
export function reverseString(str) {
  return str.split('').reverse().join('');
}
```

This implementation:

1. Takes a string input parameter
2. Splits the string into an array of characters using split('')
3. Reverses the array using reverse() 
4. Joins the characters back together into a string using join('')
5. Returns the reversed string

The implemented function will pass the test case by reversing "OpenAI" to "IAnepO".

The index.mjs file doesn't need any changes as it already contains the correct test case and error handling.

This is a clean, simple solution that uses built-in JavaScript string and array methods to reverse the string efficiently.
