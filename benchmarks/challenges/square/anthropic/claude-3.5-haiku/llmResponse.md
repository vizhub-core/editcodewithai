I'll solve this task by implementing the 'square' function in functions.mjs:

**functions.mjs**

```js
export function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}
```

The implementation is straightforward:
- Take an input number `x`
- Return `x * x`, which squares the input number
- This matches the test case in `index.mjs` which expects `square(5)` to return `25`

No changes are needed to `index.mjs`. The existing code will now run successfully, testing the square function and logging "Square test passed".
