## Suggested Changes

### **functions.mjs**

```javascript
// Entire updated code for functions.mjs
export function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}
```

This file only needs to export the `square` function, which calculates the square of a given number `x` by multiplying it with itself.

## No Changes Needed to **index.mjs**
